# Microservices POCs
This repository contains all the Proof of Concepts done by me related to microservices using springboot and java 8 features. The followings are the concepts that I have tried to implement: 
1) REST APIs
2) FeignClient Calls
3) SOAP APIs
4) Apache Kafka
5) Confluent Kafka
6) Mockito for unit testing
7) Camunda Workflow 
8) Prometheus/Grafana

There are multiple branches inside this repo and the name of each branch corresponds to the name of the microservice application. So basically each branch represents one-one project and there is a README.md file maintained inside each branch describing about the microservice application like the functionalities and what concept of the vast microservice artchitecture is used.

Any suggestions are positively welcomed !!!!
